# ml-radioboxes-model

This repository contains images used to train ML model for detecting checked or unchecked radio box before [Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/) supported this feature.

You can use Visual Studio with [ML.NET Model Builder](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder) or [Azure Cognitive Services Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/) to train from the prepared training data.

At later date, I'll publish instructions as well pre-build model with ML.NET Model Builder.
